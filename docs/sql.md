# SQL

For ad-hoc SQL, the client talks to the daemon's DataFusion-backed `/sql`
endpoint. The client never parses or interprets SQL locally; it just ships the
statement and returns the response.

## Running SQL

```perl
$db->sql("INSERT INTO orders (id, customer, amount) VALUES (99, 'Zoe', 999.0)");
$db->sql("CREATE TABLE archive AS SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > 500");
```

The client requests the JSON result format (`format => 'json'`), so a SELECT
returns its rows decoded into a Perl data structure (an arrayref of row
hashrefs keyed by column name). Statements that produce no rows
(INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, or an empty result set) return `undef`.

## DataFusion features

Because the engine delegates to DataFusion, you get its full surface for free:

```perl
# Recursive CTE
$db->sql("WITH RECURSIVE r(n) AS "
    . "(SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT n+1 FROM r WHERE n<10) SELECT n FROM r");

# Window function
$db->sql("SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER "
    . "(PARTITION BY customer ORDER BY amount DESC) FROM orders");

# CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
$db->sql("CREATE TABLE archive AS SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > 500");
```

## When to use SQL vs the query builder

- Use the [native query builder](queries.md) when you want typed conditions
  that push down to bitmap, learned-range, FM-index, or HNSW indexes. There is
  no SQL injection surface because values are serialized as typed JSON.
- Use `sql()` when you need DataFusion features the Kit endpoint does not
  expose (window functions, recursive CTEs, `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`).
